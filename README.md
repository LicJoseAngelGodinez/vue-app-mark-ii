# MOBILENDER VUE CHALLENGE
___

In this project I use Axios for api request to [REQRES](https://reqres.in/), and use Firebase for the login and the permanent session.

When this is my first full aproach to Vue, and I not finish my unit testing.

For initializations use ```npm run serve``` and you can create a new register with an email and password, very simple, then you can get logged in the app.
